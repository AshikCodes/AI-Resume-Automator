RE: {Job Title}

Dear Hiring Committee,

I’m thrilled to be applying for the {Job Title} position at {Company Name}! {1-2 sentences of why you want to work here and what makes them special to you - make this part personal and unique, avoid giving blank and boring answers} With over three years of experience in object-oriented programming and full-stack development, honed through a combination of personal and academic projects as well as professional experience as a freelance developer, I am confident that I will be a very good fit for {Company Name}'s next {Job Title} position.

Recently, I completed my final year of Computer Engineering with a specialization in Software Engineering at Toronto Metropolitan University. During my time at university, I gained substantial hands-on experience working on coding projects in object-oriented languages such as Java, as well as creating functional full-stack applications using Javascript. Notably, I collaborated with a team to develop a robust bookstore application, which involved implementing Java logic and JavaFX graphical user interfaces. The application included different screens for administrators and customers, with the former being able to add books and customers to the store, while the latter used a points system to purchase books at a discounted price. Throughout this project, we prioritized clean code and the use of appropriate design patterns to create a visually appealing and fully functional application. This experience has honed my coding skills and prepared me for taking on challenging software development roles.

My proficiency in analyzing and resolving software issues was developed through my extensive experience in developing personal projects and also my work as a Freelance Developer. One example is when I created a Lawyer CRM application as a Freelance Developer. During the course of making this application, I faced numerous challenges as this was the first time I built an industry level application for a client. Some of these challenges included ensuring proper security and authorization protocols, storage for sensitive legal documents, custom payment flows and video conferencing(WebRTC) and live messaging features(Socket.io). I successfully overcame these challenges by persisting through and conducting thorough research including reading the documentation for the different technologies I used and also leveraging resources such as Stack Overflow. This experience not only refined my technical skills but also bolstered my problem-solving and decision-making capabilities, qualities that I am eager to bring to this role at {Company Name}.

With my current skill set and my never-ending desire to keep learning, I strongly believe that with my experience in
{specific skill or technology}, I am well-equipped to {specific contribution to the company}. I look forward to hearing from you to arrange an interview at your earliest convenience. Thank you for your time and consideration.


Sincerely,
Ashik Reji

# Here is the job description and a list of my projects. Based on the job title,job duties/responsibilites, job requirements, please select the 3 projects that best align with the requirements and responsibilities outlined in the job description. Consider the following guidelines:
# 1. If the job title specifies a particular programming language or technology (e.g., Java Developer, Python Programmer), prioritize projects that use that language or technology.
# 2. If the job description emphasizes certain skills or technologies (e.g., web development, mobile app development, databases, frameworks), select projects that highlight those skills or technologies.
# 3. If the job description is broad, look for projects that cover a range of relevant skills and technologies mentioned. If you are not seeming to get anything from the job information - choose Virtual Pharmacy (Java w/ Servlets, Docker, Kuberneates, MySQL), Blogging Platform (MERN Stack w/ fly.io and CypressJS) and AI Resume/Cover Letter Builder (Python w/ OpenAI API, Tkinter, Google Drive API) 


# As an example, look at the job description: {question2_example}.

# Based on this job description and nice to have, the three best projects would be the following:

# 1. AI Resume/Cover Letter Builder (Python w/ OpenAI API, Tkinter, Google Drive API) -> Because they said 1 year of experience with Python(And this is the most comprehensive python project I made - remember focus on comprehensive - this means projects that use a lot of technologies)
# 2. Virtual Pharmacy (Java w/ Servlets, Docker, Kuberneates, MySQL)     -> Because they said experience with a cloud platform 
# 3. Blogging Platform (MERN Stack w/ fly.io and CypressJS)    -> Because they experience with relational/non-relational database and CI/CD(This is also comprehensive)


# Basically pick projects that are comprehensive and cover a lot of the technologies that the job asks for. For example the third project here is really good because it covers technologies in two points in the job description.
